# RELeARN

RELeARN (REwiring of LARge-scale Neural networks) is a project developed at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Felix Wolf](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/parallel/parallel_programming/index.en.jsp). It allows fast simulations of structural plasticity as described by Markus Butz-Ostendorf and Arjen van Ooyen in *A Simple Rule for Dendritic Spine and Axonal Bouton Formation Can Account for Cortical Reorganization after Focal Retinal Lesions*.

## Installation
Using the project required CMake, MPI and a C++ compiler capable of C++17.

## Organisation
    In relearn/ is the simulation
    In graph/ is the analyzer for the graph
